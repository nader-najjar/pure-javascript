> JavaScript best practices.

### 1. Prerequisites

---

- macOS or Linux on ARM64 or x86-64, as configured in `flake.nix`.
- Install [Nix](https://nix.dev/install-nix).
- Windows: run `wsl --install` in administrator PowerShell; after restarting and completing Linux user setup, run `wsl -- bash -lc "<INSTALL_INSTRUCTION_HERE>"` and follow the [Nix Windows (WSL2) installation instructions](https://nix.dev/install-nix) to populate the placeholder.
- Network access for uncached toolchains and dependencies.

Run the commands below from the repository root.

Optional shortcut: configure `ub` as an alias for `./universal-build`:

- Zsh/Bash: add `alias ub='./universal-build'` to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`.
- Windows PowerShell: add `function ub { wsl -- bash -lc 'exec ./universal-build "$@"' ub @args }` to `$PROFILE` (uses the default WSL distribution with Nix installed).

Restart your terminal after saving.

### 2. Build and Test

---

#### Universal Build Contract

Universal Build expects:

- `universal-build` at the project root.
- Any version of Nix on `PATH`.
- `flake.nix` at the project root.
- `flake.lock` at the project root, except for `clean` and initial `update-toolchain-lock`.
- A flake input named `nixpkgs`.
- A development shell named `buildtime`.
- `buildtime.BUILD_COMMAND` must contain the shell command to run for `build`.
- `BUILD_COMMAND` must resolve dependencies and enforce dependency locks.
- `BUILD_COMMAND` must compile the application as needed.
- `BUILD_COMMAND` must run tests and checks.
- `BUILD_COMMAND` must stage all deployable files to `build/release/idiomatic-artifacts/`.
- `buildtime.RELEASE_TYPE` set to `container` or `static`.
- `buildtime.UPDATE_IDIOMATIC_LOCK_COMMAND` must contain the shell command to refresh dependency locks for `update-idiomatic-lock`.
- `buildtime.IDE_PATH_VARS` listing space-separated environment variable names for `ide-paths`.
- Each variable listed in `IDE_PATH_VARS` to be defined in `buildtime`.
- A root `Dockerfile` for container releases.
- A flake package named `runtime` for container releases.
- The runtime package to provide executable named `ignite`.
- The runtime package to include all runtime dependencies and environment variables.
- `ignite` to accept the idiomatic artifacts directory as its first argument.
- `ignite` to execute the software's main() entrypoint based on the language being used.

For `build`, Universal Build recreates `build/release/` and archives its contents as `build/release-artifact.tar.gz`:

- `idiomatic-artifacts/`.
- `Dockerfile` for container releases.
- `runtime-artifacts/` for container releases.
- `symlink-to-absolute-ignite-script` pointing to the runtime package for container releases.

#### Everyday Commands

| Goal | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Build, test, check, and package | `./universal-build build` |
| Remove build outputs | `./universal-build clean` |
| Print IDE toolchain paths | `./universal-build ide-paths` |
| Update toolchain lock | `./universal-build update-toolchain-lock` |
| Refresh application dependency locks | `./universal-build update-idiomatic-lock` |

#### Outputs

- Test results: `build/quality-reports/tests/junit.xml`.
- Coverage: `build/quality-reports/coverage/index.html` and `build/quality-reports/coverage/lcov.info`.
- Runnable application and dependencies: `build/release/idiomatic-artifacts/`.
- Release archive: `build/release-artifact.tar.gz`.

### 3. Development Workflows

---

#### Dependency Management

Edit `package.json`:

- Add: declare the package and version in `dependencies` or `devDependencies` (see appendix).
- Remove: delete the declaration and its usages.
- Upgrade/pin: change the version or version range.

Refresh locks after adding, removing, or updating dependencies:

```sh
./universal-build update-idiomatic-lock
```

#### Toolchain Changes

| Change | Files and steps |
| --- | --- |
| Node version | Change `chosenNode` in both the buildtime shell and runtime package in `flake.nix`. Review `@types/node` and TypeScript configuration together. |
| Add a CLI tool | Add its Nix package to the development shell's `packages` in `flake.nix`. |
| Nix package set | Change `inputs.nixpkgs.url` in `flake.nix`, then run `./universal-build update-toolchain-lock`. Review and commit `flake.nix` and `flake.lock`. |
| pnpm version | Change `chosenPnpm` in `flake.nix`; `flake.lock` pins the exact release. |

After toolchain changes, run `./universal-build build`, then run `./universal-build ide-paths` and update the IDE's Node and pnpm paths.

### 4. IDE Setup

---

Print the pinned Node and pnpm locations:

```sh
./universal-build ide-paths
```

Use `NODE_BINARY` for Node and `PNPM_BINARY` for pnpm. The TypeScript SDK becomes available after the first `./universal-build build`, at the repository's `node_modules/typescript/lib` directory; use its absolute path.

Configure your IDE using these paths:

- [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate setup](https://app.notion.com/p/f4c0a2b7875583b79fa5015d58412fea)
- [Visual Studio Code setup](https://app.notion.com/p/4fd0a2b787558204a6c001d0b034f698)

Reprint the toolchain paths after Nix/toolchain changes.
